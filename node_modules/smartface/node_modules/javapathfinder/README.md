# Java-Installed-Path-Finder

This Node.js tool is used to obtain the path of the java.exe file if the desired version of Java is installed on Windows,Linux or MacOS.

#How to Use it?

javapath.js file needs to be implemented in order to use the module.

this module has a findJavaPath module which has arguments of "version"(input) and a callback function.

Sample code can be found below, which searches for installed path of Java version 1.8: (Also in the initializer.js file)

		var init = require('javapathfinder');
		init = init.findJavaPath("1.8", function(err,data){
		  if(err!=null){
		    console.log(err);
		  }
		  else{
		    console.log(data);
		  }
		});
